```

### Data Flow

1. Users input health metrics through the `HealthForm` component
2. Data is stored in the `HealthContext` context provider
3. The `HealthDashboard` component retrieves and visualizes the data
4. The `healthUtils.ts` utility calculates health scores and generates recommendations
5. The `HealthRecommendation` component displays personalized health advice

## Key Functionality Details

### Health Score Calculation

The application calculates a health score (0-10) based on the following weighted formula:
- Sleep: 30% (optimized for 7-8 hours)
- Water intake: 20% (optimized for 8+ glasses)
- Exercise: 30% (optimized for 30+ minutes)
- Mood: 20% (based on 1-5 scale)

### Recommendation System

The recommendation engine analyzes user metrics to provide:
1. Priority-based recommendations (high/medium/low)
2. Category-specific advice for areas needing improvement
3. General health assistant feedback based on overall health score

## User Interface

The application features a clean, intuitive interface with:
- A hero section explaining the application's purpose
- A tracking form for entering health metrics
- A dashboard section with visualizations
- A recommendations section with AI-generated health advice
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on all devices

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements for the HealthTrack application:

1. **User Authentication**: Add user accounts to securely store data
2. **Data Export**: Allow users to export their health data
3. **Goal Setting**: Implement personal health goals and progress tracking
4. **Push Notifications**: Add reminders for tracking health metrics
5. **Social Sharing**: Enable sharing of achievements with friends
6. **Advanced Analytics**: Provide deeper insights into health patterns

## Deployment

The application can be deployed using:
- Lovable's built-in deployment feature
- Manual deployment to services like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages after exporting to GitHub
